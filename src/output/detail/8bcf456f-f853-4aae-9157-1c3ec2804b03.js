Organisation is a main division of the superior and more generic entity Party, where Party also includes individual Person (as for example employee, maintenance responsible and driver) that are of importance for Scania.  The basic division of Organisations for Scania purposes is in Scania Unit, Production Unit, Warehouse Inventory, Distributor, Dealer, Workshop, Supplier, Customer, Customer Site and Organisation Other.  Party also has addresses with different purposes and they belongs to different Territories of different types (country, sales region, economical community etc.).  An important objective of this organisational structure is that a specific instance of an organisation, with all its descriptive facts, only will be saved once regardless of how many roles the Organisation has relationships with Scania. The substructure essentially mirrors mutually exclusive and parallel subcategories of organisations. However, for example, a Supplier may also act in the role of the Customer. In this case, it will probably have different organisational units within a main organisation to represent these different roles. An internal organisational structure can make that these can be kept together, and show that a Supplier also acts as Customer.",
