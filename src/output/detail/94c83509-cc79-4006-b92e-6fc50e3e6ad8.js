The purpose of overhead cost controlling is the planning, allocation, control, and monitoring of overhead costs.\nCost center accounting takes the costs incurred in a company and allocates them to the actual subareas that caused them. During period-end closing, these costs are distributed to cost centers through automatic allocation. By allocating the cost elements to cost centers in overhead cost controlling, one can control the costs and compare plan and actual costs. The plan/actual comparison at the end of the period helps to plan, control, and monitor cost behavior. Overhead cost controlling is also a prerequisite for further allocating overhead costs to cost objects (CO-PC), which enables to conduct a period-specific profitability analysis.",

You manage and control open items with various analytical tools to optimize accounts receivables handling. The primary source of incoming payments is incoming bank statements loaded within the Cash Management process. They are automatically reconciled with open invoices. Easy-to-use views make the post processing of open items convenient and efficient.\nAlternatively, manually post incoming payments and easily reconcile the payment with an open item. Several analytical tools are available to monitor the receivables, allowing you to react quickly if you discover a declining payment discipline among your customers. You can easily create dunning letters for overdue items and follow the dunning history of your customers.",

Organisation is a main division of the superior and more generic entity Party, where Party also includes individual Person (as for example employee, maintenance responsible and driver) that are of importance for Scania.  The basic division of Organisations for Scania purposes is in Scania Unit, Production Unit, Warehouse Inventory, Distributor, Dealer, Workshop, Supplier, Customer, Customer Site and Organisation Other.  Party also has addresses with different purposes and they belongs to different Territories of different types (country, sales region, economical community etc.).  An important objective of this organisational structure is that a specific instance of an organisation, with all its descriptive facts, only will be saved once regardless of how many roles the Organisation has relationships with Scania. The substructure essentially mirrors mutually exclusive and parallel subcategories of organisations. However, for example, a Supplier may also act in the role of the Customer. In this case, it will probably have different organisational units within a main organisation to represent these different roles. An internal organisational structure can make that these can be kept together, and show that a Supplier also acts as Customer.",
