The purpose of overhead cost controlling is the planning, allocation, control, and monitoring of overhead costs.\nCost center accounting takes the costs incurred in a company and allocates them to the actual subareas that caused them. During period-end closing, these costs are distributed to cost centers through automatic allocation. By allocating the cost elements to cost centers in overhead cost controlling, one can control the costs and compare plan and actual costs. The plan/actual comparison at the end of the period helps to plan, control, and monitor cost behavior. Overhead cost controlling is also a prerequisite for further allocating overhead costs to cost objects (CO-PC), which enables to conduct a period-specific profitability analysis.",
